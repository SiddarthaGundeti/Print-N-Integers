# Print-N-Integers

Question: Print N Integers

Input: 3

Output: 1 2 3

Write a program to print integers from 1 to the given integer (N).

Input:
The first line of input will contain a positive integer.

Output:
The output should be of N lines, printing an integer in each line.

Explanation:
For example, if the given number is 3, your code should print the

Similarly, if the given number is 5, your code should print the

Approach:
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input value representing the integer N.
Initialize a counter variable to 1.
Use a while loop to print integers from 1 to N.
Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Read the input

Read the input value representing the integer N. We can use the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 2: Initialize a counter

Initialize a counter variable to 1. This counter will help us keep track of the current integer we need to print.

Step 3: Print integers using a while loop

Use a while loop to print integers from 1 to N. Inside the loop, print the value of the counter and then increment it by 1. The loop should continue until the counter is greater than N.
